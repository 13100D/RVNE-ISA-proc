Synaptic weight and spike vector Load / store instructions

* I.e. we need to have our registers up and our fetch decode  stages running
* Paper also defined some goofy thing called a **Vector Load Store Unit (VLSU)** This handles loading weights and spike vectors from memory into the WVR and SVR, respectively. It supports different granularities for these loads (e.g., 32, 128, or 512 inputs).Essentially to load a fuck ton of registers at the same time because vectors makes sense
* Memory access ??? how ??? how to access like memory idts this has been covered in class much
* Also we need these registers:

distinct registers defined for each type is as follows:

1. **Weight Vector Register (WVR):**
   * Used to store synaptic weights for neurons.
   * **Register Count:** The ISA defines **32 WVRs**, with the ability to load subsets (e.g., 1, 4, or all WVRs) during instruction execution.
   * **Bit Width:** Each WVR stores **128 bits**.
   * **Usage:** These registers store the synaptic weights for each neuron.
   * **Addressing:** WVRs are addressed using the register index, which is determined by the instruction fields `rd` and `rs1`. The base and shift memory addresses stored in `rs1` and the immediate field (`imm`) determine which WVRs are loaded.

2. **Spike Vector Register (SVR):**
   * Stores input spike trains.
   * **Register Count:** The ISA defines **16 SVRs**, capable of loading spikes with different granularities (e.g., 32, 128, or 512 spikes at a time).
   * **Bit Width:** Each SVR stores **32 bits**.
   * **Usage:** SVRs hold spike trains, with each bit representing the state (spike/no spike) of a neuron.
   * **Addressing:** Similar to WVRs, the register index is specified by the instruction fields (`rd`, `rs2`), and the base and shift addresses help in loading the correct spikes into the SVR.

3. **Neuron State Register (NSR):**
   * Holds neuron states such as current, voltage, and spike sums.
   * **Register Count:** The ISA defines **1024 NSRs** to store neuron states for large-scale parallel neuron computation.
   * **Bit Width:** Each NSR stores **1024 bits**.
   * **Usage:** NSRs keep neuron states, including membrane potential, current, and spike count.
   * **Addressing:** NSRs are addressed through `rd` or `rs2`, typically indexed indirectly based on instruction inputs.

4. **Spike Output Register (SOR):**
   * Stores spikes generated by neurons for reuse in the next time step.
   * **Register Count:** The ISA defines **16 SORs**.
   * **Bit Width:** Each SOR stores **32 bits**.
   * **Usage:** These registers hold output spikes generated by the neurons.
   * **Addressing:** Like SVRs, the SORs are addressed via the `rs1` and `rd` fields of the instructions.

###

The addressing of these registers in instructions typically involves **register indexing** with the instruction fields (`rd`, `rs1`, and `rs2`) determining which register to access. The **base memory address** and **immediate field** (`imm`) further modify the address during vector loads and stores.

This addressing mechanism allows the instructions to target specific registers or groups of registers, supporting flexible parallelism and ensuring that neuromorphic computations (spike propagation, synaptic weight updates) are efficiently managed.
